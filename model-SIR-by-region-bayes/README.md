# model-SIR-by-region-bayes

Run `fitlsq.py`. You have to specify at least a command line argument:

```
fitlsq.py weakpop|truepop
```

You you specify `weakpop`, the prior on the population of the regions is very
weak, so the fit will find an "effective population" that suits the SIR.
Instead if you specify `truepop` the population is fixed to the true population.

By default `fitlsq.py` fits all regions. You can specify a subset of regions
on the command line:

```
fitlsq.py weakpop|truepop Veneto Umbria Puglia ...
```

`lsqfit.py` will produce a file named `fitlsq_something.pickle`. Run
`fitlsqplot.py <file generated by fitlsq>` to make the plots, which will be
saved in the directory `fitlsqplot/`. Run `fitlsqpred.py <etc.pickle>` to
compute predictions for the next two weeks and save them in `../predictions/`.

## Programs

  * `fitlsq.py`: regularized least squares fit. A sort of approximate bayesian
    fit.

  * `fitlsqplot.py`: plot `fitlsq.py` output.
  
  * `fitlsqpred.py`: write prediction `.csv` files.
  
  * `fitlsqdefs.py`: common stuff for `fitlsq*`.
    
  * `fitmap.py`: maximum a posteriori fit.
    
  * `fitmapplot.py`: plot `fitmap.py` output.
    
  * `plotregions.py`: single plot with all the regions.
    
  * `namedate.py`: just a function to make timestamps.
