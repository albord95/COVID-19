# model-SIR-by-region-bayes

I'm trying to implement a bayesian inference with the SIR separately on each
Italian region.

## Quickstart

Run `fitlsq.py`. It will produce a file named `fitlsq_something.pickle`.
Run `fitlsqplot.py <file generated by fitlsq>` to make the plots, which will
be saved in the directory `fitlsqplot/`.

## Programs

  * `fitlsq.py`: regularized least squares fit. A sort of approximate bayesian
    fit.

  * `fitlsqplot.py`: plot `fitlsq.py` output.
  
  * `fitlsqdefs.py`: common stuff for `fitlsq*`.
    
  * `fitmap.py`: maximum a posteriori fit.
    
  * `fitmapplot.py`: plot `fitmap.py` output.
    
  * `plotregions.py`: single plot with all the regions.
    
  * `namedate.py`: just a function to make timestamps.
