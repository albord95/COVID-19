# model-SIR-region-truepop

Run `fitlsq.py`. It will produce a file named `fitlsq_something.pickle`.
Run `fitlsqplot.py <file generated by fitlsq>` to make the plots, which will
be saved in the directory `fitlsqplot/`. Run `fitlsqpred.py <etc.pickle>` to
compute predictions for the next two weeks and save them in `../predictions/`.

This model is the same as `SIR-by-region-bayes`, except the total population
parameter has a strong prior on the true population instead of a weak one, and
the prediction uncertainties are rescaled using `sqrt(chi^2/dof)`.

## Programs

  * `fitlsq.py`: regularized least squares fit. A sort of approximate bayesian
    fit.

  * `fitlsqplot.py`: plot `fitlsq.py` output.
  
  * `fitlsqdefs.py`: common stuff for `fitlsq*`.
    
  * `namedate.py`: just a function to make timestamps.
